\subsection{Acknowledgements}

This project made use of the \href{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/}{\texttt{scikit-learn}} and \href{http://pybrain.org}{\texttt{PyBrain}} machine learning libraries, the Python mathematics package \href{http://numpy.org}{\texttt{NumPy}}, and the plotting library \href{http://matplotlib.org}{\texttt{matplotlib}}.

The project code is derived from Joshua Morton's \href{https://github.com/joshuamorton/Machine-Learning/blob/master/P1/Adults/adult.py}{\texttt{machine learning driver code}} for Spring 2015 CS 4641 project 1, which was then heavily modified by the author.
