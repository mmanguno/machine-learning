\section{Conclusions}

We have seen five algorithms run over two data sets. Among them, many seemed to over-fit and produce erroneous results. From my analysis, \textit{k}-nearest neighbors appears to be the best algorithm with the given data sets. Of them, it was the only one that did not grossly over-fit the data (i.e. have a training curve reach 100\% accuracy), although the results it did produce are far too highly accurate to be within the realm of belief.
