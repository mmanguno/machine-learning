Georgia Tech's CS-4641 Machine Learning, runs and results

Included are three types of information per directory:

1. One or more sets of data, NOT generated/gathered by myself. This data is
   owned/licensed by their respective owners/licensees (information concerning
   this is included in the respective directory's `README.md` file).
2. Code for running the analysis on the data set(s). The majority of this code
   was NOT written by myself. Generally, only small modifications were made
   to accomodate the particular dimensions/values of my data sets. Authorship
   information is included in each file.
3. An analysis, written in LaTeX. This analysis is authored by me, and
   released under the [GNU Free Documentation License][0] to ensure its free
   use.
